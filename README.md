Choose between these two and rename your chosen tlp conf into "tlp.conf"

amd never lagged...
btw this actually better than windows...

intel tlp conf needed to be tested more throughoutly...

use the kernal setting instead...

Current Intel ones lags...
Intel's mobile chips consumes a lot of power is because their integrated gpu are not as efficient as amd one... Intel ultra 9 100 series's power efficiency is only comparable with amd's 4000 series unless this kernal setting is added into the system... but that would kind of degrade a bit of performances if compared to amd does... look out of latency issues however it does actually improved a lot of power efficiency to be actually competing against 5000 and 6000 series cpu. But these cpu are literally at least four year old and intels ultra 9 100 only just on par against them. Mobile cpus are more dependent on lithography scales. Intel's cpu and gpu has be stuck at 7nm for decade not until ultra second gen which it just had 5nm literally devouring the first gen cpus for power efficiency. Wait for third gen dont be like me buying first gen. Get AMD if better i would personally value AMD cpu more than intel does...
its not about cheap or expensiveness, it now mre about power efficiency and driver support.
AMD's gpu driver support are wayyyyyyy better than intels currently. Get that if possible.
I have a feeling that their intels driver support for these kernal settings are heavily dependent on their hardware itself... if thats so then its hella not recommended if using it for long term. Think about it, your battery die faster if your cpu consumes too much making it more freq in changing battery. So you would need to spend more money on it compared to AMD does. This is not marketing, this is non-biased opinions. Intels cpu has its their own benefits, it performs really good if its on power and compile stuff if theres lots of cores. Yes its twice faster than my ryzen 7 5800H but not of its efficiency by default. TLP should implement more intel settings so we could share and actually make more competitive against AMD.

the gray gradient the wider the less detail looses in videos.
DO NOT GET A BAD SDR PANEL
how to spot bad LCD panel:
  does not have wide grey gradient covers and that dimms and losing details. 
  get at least hdr certified lcd screen instead of any other bullshit dolby vision and other craps
  HDR OVER DOLBY VISION OR ANY MARKETING SHIT
  get a least 100% srgb graded panel 100%DCI is better ofc it defo makes your movie look good
  HDR400 isnt that bad, it actually helps in a lot of SDR content...
  ANYTHING up to HDR400 is a must...
  OLED well if you get HDR certified monitor OLED might not even a necessary...
