## Choose between these two and rename your chosen tlp conf into `tlp.conf`

- **um careful on this SATA_LINKPWR_ON_BAT="min_power" setting**
- it could cause some data corruptions if used on certain hardware

- **AMD never lagged...**
  - btw this actually better than windows...

- **Intel tlp conf needed to be tested more throughoutly...**
  - use the kernal setting instead... load in that i915 file...
  - Current Intel ones lags...
  - Intel's mobile chips consumes a lot of power is because their integrated gpu are not as efficient as amd one...
  - Intel ultra 9 100 series's power efficiency is only comparable with amd's 4000 series unless this kernal setting is added into the system...  
    - but that would kind of degrade a bit of performances if compared to amd does...
    - look out of latency issues however it does actually improved a lot of power efficiency to be actually competing against 5000 and 6000 series cpu.  
      - But these cpu are literally at least four year old and intels ultra 9 100 only just on par against them.  
      - Mobile cpus are more dependent on lithography scales.  
  - Intel's cpu and gpu has be stuck at 7nm for decade not until ultra second gen which it just had 5nm literally devouring the first gen cpus for power efficiency.  
    - Wait for third gen dont be like me buying first gen.  
  - Get AMD if better i would personally value AMD cpu more than intel does...  
  - Its not about cheap or expensiveness, it now mre about power efficiency and driver support.  
  - AMD's gpu driver support are wayyyyyyy better than intels currently. Get that if possible.  

- **I have a feeling that their intels driver support for these kernal settings are heavily dependent on their hardware itself...**  
  - if thats so then its hella not recommended if using it for long term.  
  - Think about it, your battery die faster if your cpu consumes too much making it more freq in changing battery.  
  - So you would need to spend more money on it compared to AMD does.

## I AM NOT SURE WHY PEOPLE BUY INTEL CPU IF THEY PLAN TO USE LAPTOP ON BATTERY FOR EXTENDED PERIOD ON LONG TERM?  
- ITS A VERY INEFFICIENT CPU/GPU UNDER METEOR LAKE SERIES anything under Ultra series... DO NOT BUY **I REPEAT DO NOT BUY**... You do not use its full potential when on battary right? having high performance cpu with lots of inefficiency factors should be avoided at all costs, for laptops in this case it is better to have very efficient cpu and gpu with glorious driver support in-kernal and software support.  Intel actually has plans not to actually improve their old products... Their hybrid cpu structures schedulers are actually bad well yes its driver problem well the table can still be turned if intel decided to actually improve their driver support significantly to be be able to compete AMDs... Its not to late i guess...

- **This is not marketing, this is non-biased opinions.**  
  - Intels cpu has its their own benefits, it performs really good if its on power and compile stuff if theres lots of cores.  
  - Yes its twice faster than my ryzen 7 5800H but not of its efficiency by default.  
  - TLP should implement more intel settings so we could share and actually make more competitive against AMD.

 **Brother Nvidia gpu is actually good the 3000 series sucks too much ppower is because it does not support power saving features which makes it high power consumption on idle** 
till 4000 series gpu that actually does a lot of differences in power consumption when little or none usages... Hybrid is actually recommended... 5000 series could be an serious upgrade from 4000 series... Its better to wait for 5000 rather than getting 4000 series. 

## The Gray Gradient and Display Panel Recommendations

- **The gray gradient:**  
  - The wider the gradient, the less detail looses in videos.
  - HDR pushes these wayy better than SDR does making it lose less visual details on the go
  - Trust me this is important feature you should not ignore it...
  - The longer it has the more details you will see

- **DO NOT GET A BAD SDR PANEL**  
  - How to spot bad LCD panel:  
    - Does not have wide grey gradient covers and that dimms and losing details.
    - A grey gradient should be over that HDR word in that itchio software... It should looks no bars across the screen...
    - All SDR scrrens will never ever pass that HDR word in grey gradient which located right above the the gradient bar...  Uh its the tool thing where you test for its grey bar gradeient.
    - Get at least hdr certified lcd screen instead of any other bullshit dolby vision and other craps.  
    - **HDR OVER DOLBY VISION OVER ANY MARKETING SHIT**
    - Dolby vision is a nice touch tech but you wont be using it full advantage all the time why have hdr?
    - HDR panel tend to push more grey contrast than SDR without HDR mode on making it look good on any sdr panels out there.
    - you will be able to use hdr with rtx(nvidia with windows 11 only cmon why no on linux)

- **Get a least 100% sRGB graded panel**  
  - 100%DCI is better ofc it defo makes your movie look good.  
  - HDR400 isnt that bad, it actually helps in a lot of SDR content...  
  - ANYTHING up to HDR400 is a must... REGARDLESS OF NOT HAVE NO DOLBY VISION SUPPORT OR SHITS well dolby vision has good sites but IT WILL NOT WORK ALL THE TIME IT ONLY APPLIES TO MEDIAS THAT HAS DOLBY VISION HDR ENCODING. ALSO THEIR MARKETING ARE SHIT, IF THE MONITOR DOES NOT HAVE HDR BUT DOLBY VISION SUPPORTED IT WILL STILL NOT GOING TO DISPLAY HDR FOR YOU. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DOLBYVISION, THERES DOLBYVISION HDR and DOLBYVISION. Careful when buying new panels...
  - HDR certified panel looked gorgeous on linux even thought it doesnt support hdr yet
  - use my mpv configs

- **OLED**  
  - Well if you get HDR certified monitor OLED might not even a necessary...

HDR CERTIFIED MONITOR WILL GET YOU BETTER QUALITY SDR MOVIES FOR SURE

https://momoirosoft.itch.io/hdr-demo?download test your monitor with this tool... wel its windows only but its worthwhile to try it out... Try compare with HDR on and off theres huge difference in visual quality. Yes its supposed to looked more cinematic with hdr. 

Well most of my friend arent friend so technically im friendless...
